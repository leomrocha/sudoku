# Sudoku solver set

This small project contains a SUDOKU solver, the tests, generator and documentation.

Depending on time and other activities


##TLDR

###Command Line Usage

###Web based site
    
    
##Goals of this little project

Entering the Insight Data Engineering program.

Build a complete program that can be used and understood by other people and can be used also as a Python example project.

Build from simple algorithms and while time is available, build more complex solvers

##Scope

Time limited:



##Sudoku Problem Description


###Vocabulary

Row:
Colum:
Quadrant:
Dimension:
Sum:


##Planning

###Considerations
As I like to think on challenges before searching for the solutions:
1st: how do I solve Sudoku puzzles? -> this indicates finding candidates and backtracking

A easier approach would be: implement backtracking and then start adding constraints (candidates for row/column/quadrant)


Problem: **SUDOKU** solver

Sudoku characteristics:
    []() Wikipedia page
    

Algorithms:
    backtracking
    constraint problem
    

###Limitations

I'm not a really fast coder, I do take my time to think about algorithms and technology.

I arrive late at night and tired and have other activities, 

###Development

##Usage

###Command Line

###Web (Brython)

##Technical Details

##Backtracking

##Constraints

##Conclussions

##Future

Add more algorithms, 
I would like to have one algorithm of each type and an analysis of time and memory complexity of each
